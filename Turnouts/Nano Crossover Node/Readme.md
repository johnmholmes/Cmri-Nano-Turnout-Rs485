This will be very simular to the single turnout node. 
But will use pin 2 for turnout 1 and pin 3 for turnout 2,
It will control 6 signal heads in JMRI 
and will allow 4 sensors to be used
2 bits have been setup for turnout feed
and again use the bi-directional TTl to RS485 module.
The code uses address 8 in this sketch

In JMRI settings

Turnout 1 use address 8001

Turnout 2 use address 8002

Led 1 use address 8003

Led 12 use address 8014

Turnout1 feed back use address 8001

Turnout2 feed back use address 8002

Sensor1 use address 8003

Sensor4 use address 8007
