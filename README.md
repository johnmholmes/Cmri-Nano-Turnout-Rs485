# Cmri-Nano-Turnout-Rs485 to TTL Bilateral Module UART Port Serial Converter Module 3.3/5V Power Signal
A simple Cmri node using arduino nano and a TTL to RS485 RS485 to TTL Bilateral Module UART Port Serial Converter Module 3.3/5V Power Signal to control 1 turnout and 4 tmc 2 aspect signals.

This will require only 2 Libraries to be used "CMRI.h" + "Servo.h".

The RS485 unit will be attched to Rx and Tx pins on the Arduino Nano pins 0 and 1.

The servo will be attched to pin 3 i have left pin 2 empty in this case as previously was used for the 3 wire Rs485 units.

The 8 leds will be atached to pins 4 to 11.

And i have 5 infra red modules atached  to pins A0 to A4.

In this exsample the node address will be 3 but can be  changed to any value not being used.

The Ardino is simulating a Cmri SMINI node which can have 24 imputs and 48 outputs for Jmri use.

The TMC 2 asspect signals use a 5v commom positive to get the power to the leds and that goes onto the 5volt rail 4 off on the shield.
The remaining 8 wires go to the Arduino Nano pins 4 to 11.

In Jmri will need 1 turnout to be created to use 1 bit steady state with address of 3001 in this case.
And also 4 Signal Heads to be created Signal head 1 will use create new and green with address 3002 and create new for red with address 3003.
This will need to be done for the remaining 3 signal heads.

The 5 infra red sensors will be attched to pins A0 to A4 and grounded to the gnd rail on the shield. these will uses address 3002 to 3006.

There is a bit message returned to jmri with address 3001 which i use for feedback on the turnout butnot a micro switch in this case. this only uses the arduino code to create the message.


Hopefully it can help you to learn how to do
