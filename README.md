# Cmri using arduino Nano's and the Bi-directional TTL to RS485 modules

The original idea was to create many reposatories with different Nodes to show these in use, 

but i have decided maybe just keep one reposatory with diferent folders showing examples for usages
of the units.

there are now 3 folders containing 3 different Nodes avaiable

1.Single turnout with 4 signal heads and 5 sensors on a Nano

2.Crossover turnouts 6 signal head and 4 sensors on a Nano

3.First Mimic panel controls 5 routes in JMRI and has 3 block occupancy leds and 7 leds showing 
the turnout position
