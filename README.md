# Cmri using arduino Nano's and the Bi-directional TTL to RS485 modules

The original idea was to create many reposatories with different Nodes to show these in use, 

but i have decided maybe just keep one reposatory with diferent folders showing examples for usages
of the units.

there are now 4 folders containing 4 different Nodes avaiable.

1. Single turnout with 4 signal heads and 5 sensors on a Nano.

2. Crossover turnouts 6 signal head and 4 sensors on a Nano.

3. First Mimic panel controls 5 routes in JMRI and has 3 block occupancy leds and 7 leds showing 
the turnout position.

4. I have also now decided to add some python scripts i use to add some automation to the layout.

5. I have now added the 2nd Mimic panel which is based on a Arduino Mega but still uses the same RS485 unit.
