# Cmri using arduino Nano's and the Bi-directional TTL to RS485 modules

The original idea was to create many reposatories with different Nodes to show these in use, 

but i have decided maybe just keep one reposatory with diferent folders show exsamples for usages
of the units.

The 1st complete folder is the single turnout Node.

The 2nd folder will be the crossover Node.

The 3rd folder will be a picture folde.

The 4th folder will be a simple mimic panel.
