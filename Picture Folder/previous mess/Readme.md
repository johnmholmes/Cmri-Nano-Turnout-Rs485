This shows the original setup for controlling 16 servos and 46 sensors 
this worked ok but i was not happy with it. 

So I decided to change to local nodes, which will control the 1 or 2 servos maximum and hopefully will give more reliabilty.

Each servo had its own cat 5 cable going from the pwm module.

And every 6 sensors shared a cat 5 cable wit 5 volt and a ground cable.

The block detection Arduino Mega may stay the way it is so far there is 12 MERG kits which report the status of 2 blocks each, this could be changed
at a later date as a further 8 more units maybe required for upper level monitoring.
